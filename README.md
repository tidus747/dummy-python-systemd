# Systemd creating user/system services and packages

In this repository two examples are shown for the creation of services using Systemd. In the first case, you can find an example (with corresponding explanation) of how to create a user service. Later, the creation of system services is also introduced.

On the other hand, you can find the information and examples needed to generate packages containing the implementation of services to be installed in the system.
